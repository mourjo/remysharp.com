# Why do we own tech that we don't really own?

I really don't know if this is a new (new being in the last few decades) phenomenon, or perhaps it was always destined to be this way, but it seems daft to me that we, consumers, buy and - in theory - own tech that we don't own at all.

_What on earth are you talking about Remy?_

## Let me start with an analogy

In the UK, housing falls (mostly) into renting and owning. The owning is the goal (it's a weird English thing - I know our european friends don't have this hang up).

Anyway, when you rent a place, there's normally a list of conditions and rules. A set of typical rules would be: don't hang pictures or put nails in the walls, don't redecorate, don't change the carpets or remove walls, etc.

You can live in the place, but it's not really yours. Makes sense. That's renting.

When you own a property, you can change anything inside you want. If you ignore all safety you could (yourself) knock down all the walls and live amongst bricks.

The outside of the house is slightly different, partly (I _think_) because the aesthetics are shared with your neighbours. But _inside_ is yours, you can do what you want.

I used to think that technology was similar, but it really isn't like that.

## We don't own tech

First the obvious one is the [right to repair](https://repair.eu/) - though this doesn't _prevent_ you per-se from opening or changing a tech thing, it just utterly voids the warranty (plus companies don't want you to be poking around their insidesâ€¦ stupid if you ask me).

But then there's products like the iPhone. There's apps on the phone that you have no way to remove. It's your phone, you should be able to put what you want on there _and_ remove apps as you please.

You can't remove those apps because the reality is that Apple owns and dictates what you can do on your phone. And this goes without saying - the whole "we only let one browser on our phones" thing.

Another example: Spotify. As a fully paying member you'd think that I could open the app and listen to the music I'm paying to hear. Instead, I'm pushed podcasts, or audiobooks, or shows (to the point where [I fixed some it myself using hacks](https://remysharp.com/2021/08/17/removing-shows-from-spotify)) - but the fact that the business pushes this content to me when I never subscribed to it just shows how little ownership I have of my subscription.

My family owns two Nintendo Switch's. I had bought Animal Crossing and the kids played it. Except the entire game world belongs - and is controlled by - the first kid to play the game. Although we have multiple accounts on the Switch, only one person in our family can progress the game.

I bought a second copy of the game for the second Switch, but we also have a family Expansion Pack subscription, but as soon as I downloaded the Animal Crossing DLC on _one_ of the Switches, it prevented the _other_ Switch from playing the game.
