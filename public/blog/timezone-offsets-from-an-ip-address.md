# Timezone offsets from an IP address

Following on from my [hard](/2023/06/29/ip-to-timezone-the-hard-but-fast-way) and [easy way](/2023/07/03/ip-to-timezone-the-30-second-way) of getting timezone from an IP address, having the timezone (as text) is one thing, now finding the actual offset is entirely a different problem.

TL:DR; jump to the [spoiler](#temporal-api-working-with-dates-and-times) if you can't be bothered to read/listen to me ramble!

## The problem isn't timezones, it's day light saving

It's all very well knowing what timezone a particularly location is sitting on. We can show the user the UTC time, but when it doesn't match the wall clock because they're currently observing DST, then it's justâ€¦weird.

So now we need to know if the location is observing DST, or not. Or if perhaps they never observe DST (like Hawaii).

## The long hard way

There is the [IANA timezone dataset](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) which has custom data structures that describe the location and how time is observed in that location for that particular date. Which is very cool because you can say: for the Ukraine, in 1921 on Thursday 5th July - were they observing DST or not.

There's a library in Python that does read this data straight off the shelf, but I couldn't find anything for JavaScript, so I went about parsing it myself.

The documentation is generally pretty useful, describing the structures:

**From the source file**

```text
#Rule NAME    FROM TO    -   IN  ON      AT   SAVE LETTER
Rule  Chicago 1920 only  -   Jun 13      2:00 1:00 D
Rule  Chicago 1920 1921  -   Oct lastSun 2:00 0    S
Rule  Chicago 1921 only  -   Mar lastSun 2:00 1:00 D
Rule  Chicago 1922 1966  -   Apr lastSun 2:00 1:00 D
Rule  Chicago 1922 1954  -   Sep lastSun 2:00 0    S
Rule  Chicago 1955 1966  -   Oct lastSun 2:00 0    S
```

I got fairly far, but hadn't implemented the `lastSun`, `firstMon`, `Sun>=8` syntax (do drop a comment if you think this library might be useful).

The reason I stopped was because I remembered there was a way in literally a single line of code: [Temporals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal).

## Temporal API: working with dates and times

The JavaScript `Date` API is, in my own opinion, one of the worst parts of JavaScript. The temporal API does a massive overhaul of date and time processing, and, it so happens, it can give me whether a datetime is in DST for a given timezone.

```js
Temporal.Now.instant().toZonedDateTimeISO("Europe/London").offset;
// => "+01:00"
```

Just like that, I've got my timezone offset lookup. Although, since both Node and Deno (since I was using [Netlify Edge functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/) which use Deno) doesn't have the API natively, I need to load the polyfill first:

```js
import { Temporal } from 'https://esm.sh/@js-temporal/polyfill';
```

And that was it. Two extra lines gave me the timezone offset: [days-to-xmas](https://days-to-xmas.isthe.link/) ([source](https://github.com/remy/days-to-christmas/blob/4ce75316795d890a21b55e663f71ab753c312e4d/netlify/edge-functions/days/days.js)).
