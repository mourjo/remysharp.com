# Apple going to kneecap the web: PWAs

Remember the days that Apple used to pitch itself as *David* in the David and Goliath stories? Well, the tables have turned. Apple, in a short number of days, are going to intentionally kill off PWA support.

This affects developers, businesses *and* users.

When any documentation eventually emerged, Apple not only intentionally confused readers as to the reasoning, but also lied, and not just a little lie, [just outright lie](https://infrequently.org/2024/02/home-screen-advantage/#lies%2C-damned-lies%2C-and-%22still%2C-we-regret...%22).

Alex Russell has an [excellent long form piece that explains the reality](https://infrequently.org/2024/02/home-screen-advantage/) of what's going on. Take 20 minutes of your day and read it.

## Do two things

There's two things you can do to help to _attempt_ to fight back against Goliath Apple:

1. [Sign the open letter to Tim Cook](https://letter.open-web-advocacy.org/)
2. Blog (feel free to [copy this post](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/blob/main/public/blog/apple-trying-to-kneecap-the-web-pwas.md) if you want), toot, bookface, linkitin, tweet (or ecksâ€¦?) - it doesn't have to be long, but it has to be now.

Safari has long held users back. If Apple succeed here, they'll have delivered a heavy blow to the open web (and frankly, some decent choices for your phones).
