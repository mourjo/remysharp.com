# Is web developer a "subject"?

First, yes, but I didn't know how to title this post for myself.

I've been having a crisis of faith (multiple actually, but let's try to focus). I wanted to get in touch with local universities to let them know about [FFConf](https://2024.ffconf.org) student tickets, and I figured it would make sense to contact factualities that are web development related.

Except…I couldn't find any.

Admittedly I'm only looking in the UK and I'm really looking at local universities - so I imagine web dev is a subject … somewhere. I _did_ notice however, that there's lots of subjects under the umbrella of computing and under engineering.

All legitimate, and I also noticed that "Artificial Intelligence" is a subject in those faculties. Heck, I even did a unit on AI back in 1998 (I even have the paper, all 10 pages of it… I'd share if/when I find it again, it's fairly stupid).

I think web development would belong under computing, it's not engineering. The subjects I see now are things like (and this is abridged), Fintech, Games, Data Science and (just) Computing.

Then I start to wonder, what is web development these days? And by "these days", I actually mean in the industry and at the career level, i.e. not side project blog.
