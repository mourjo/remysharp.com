# tracegl for JavaScript debugging

In preparing for my new Node workshop (tickets go [on sale Wednesday 10am](https://leftlogic.stagehq.com/events/2287) - set alarm!) my tool of choice *used* to be [node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector) but development has gone idle (for a year to date) and it's showing it's age. However, recently I came across [tracegl](http://trace.gl) I was intrigued as it looked to add to my debugging tools for Node.

tracegl was so much more than I realised: it captures full JavaScript state a *all* points of my application's execution - **both** on the server side, but also the client side.

## Debugging a real bug with tracegl

[Rik Arends](http://twitter.com/rikarends) includes an introductory video on the [site](http://trace.gl), and the script is â‚¬12 - which frankly is a steal for what it provides me. If you're join [my Node workshop](https://leftlogic.stagehq.com/events/2287) - I'm proving a licensed copy for everyone (because I think it should be part of your core stack).

I've included a short video of how I've used tracegl to debug my server side application. A few important things to note are: the trace is historical - and not blocking execution, which is what I'd normally do if I had to debug: I'd carefully replicate the issue, then either add a conditional breakpoint or `debugger` statement - but with tracegl, the bug can occur, and if tracegl is running, I can just look back at the state of the problem.

## Learning more

I'm running a new crash course in Node on July, and similar the past it's known to have sold out in a week. Tickets go on sale on Wednesday at 10am (UK) and will be [available here](https://leftlogic.stagehq.com/events/2287).

I'll be using this tool and many others to give you a fully packed day of knowledge on how to use Node, how to develop sites and real-time applications, and what tools I use for debugging, publishing and deployment.

So [grab a ticket](https://leftlogic.stagehq.com/events/2287) if you want my hands on, "knowledge smash & grab" course (or check out [more details here](http://leftlogic.com/training#node1day)).
