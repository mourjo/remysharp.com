I bought a joblot of Pebble watches a while back (only to secure a Pebble Round to gift to my mum), but it also included a Pebble Steel. Though the watched happily charged and turned on, when I unplugged the charging port, the watch immediately died.

When I got around to opening the watch (using the same screw bit for the [classic](https://remysharp.com/tif/2023-04-05-pebble)) the lipo battery inside had â€¦ popped, I guess. It was bad.

Thankfully I found a few replacements on Ebay (as the batteries are particularly small) and with some careful soldering (to some very small solder point) and squeezing of wires to fit into such a tiny space, the Pebble Steel lives again. That's 3 Pebbles I've revived in recent months - I've just got one Pebble Classic left to fix!
