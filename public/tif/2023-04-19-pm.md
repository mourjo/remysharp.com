I love these little cartridge based handhelds (apparently the smallest released). I've got a few that I'm working on repairing because they fail pretty hard when corrosion gets in there.

However, in this particular case, though it was sold as "junk", only the left button on the dpad was failing. A good scrub with IPA and it was back working. Hugely simple compared to the ones with corrosion!
