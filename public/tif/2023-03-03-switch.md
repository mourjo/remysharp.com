Upon testing this, indeed it didn't turn on. I was ready to pull it apart and start probing the circuit, when my son started "playing" with it, and somehow it came on. Turned out it was _just_ the power button that was faulty.

On further testing though, there were more faults due to corrosion (which had also eaten the power ribbon cable): the digitiser (the touch screen) was missing a column of input (where there was a big dent in the display) and the USB-C port had corrosion but also broken pins inside.

I replaced the digitiser, the power ribbon cable and (after _many_ hours struggling with solder in tiny holes) replaced the USB-C port. All good again.
