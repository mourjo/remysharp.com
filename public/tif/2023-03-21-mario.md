I had an old and very, _very_ corroded copy of Super Mario 2: The Golden Rings for the Game Boy. I'd [previously restored it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/xlu46y/restoring_super_mario_land_2_for_the_hell_of_it/) but as one commenter suggested, the corrosion will continue to eat away. So the other night, using hot air and a lot of flux, I transferred all the parts to a new PCB and Mario is right as rain again.
