I bought a joblot of Switch Joycons (because apparently I find it straightforward to fix…). £50 (plus £7 postage - which I think was overpriced) - but I have all the parts to replace most common faults, so now I have six fixed joycons (ranged from thumb sticks, shoulder buttons, LEDs and more).

Off to eBay they go!
