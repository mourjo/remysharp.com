I'd originally sold this on eBay but after some exchanges with the buyer, it was returned.

Seeing it first hand, with the new IPS display *and* flashy images, the power LED would start to flash between red and green even with fresh batteries. This is a sign that the power supply is "dirty". Literally. So I removed the switch, completely opened it, cleaned with IPA and it's working again.
