My son has been telling his friends that I can fix things, so I'm starting to see more gaming bits arrive via them! This joypad wasn't registering movement properly in both thumbsticks.

I thought it might need replacement thumbsticks (actually bought some but they didn't fit) but it was actually a damn good cleaning with IPA that it needed.

IPA FTW.

*[IPA]: Isopropyl alcohol
*[FTW]: For the win
