I was kindly sent a Pebble Time Steel as a possible replacement for my own Pebble Time watch - and though it was in great condition and it powered on when charging, as soon as the power was disconnected, the watch powered off.

I hunted down the right replacement lipo battery, the SP551923AE thankfully available on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001452083086.html). Heated the watch to melt the glue, opened and careful soldered the replacement battery onto the Pebble PCB (because I didn't want to remove the original battery connector and add it the new lipo battery - it seemed like a risky job).

A tiny job, but a very nice result.
