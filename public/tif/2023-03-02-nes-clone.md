Random eBay purchase: wouldn't turn on and the power adapter wasn't included. It's old enough that the power supply was a barrel jack with negative centre (these days it's positive centre).

Once I opened it, inside was questionable quality soldering and actual hot glue hold it together. Quickly tracing the power supply led me to the MOSFET looking thing - actually the voltage regulator 7805.

Replaced the voltage regulator and we're all good again. Yay.
