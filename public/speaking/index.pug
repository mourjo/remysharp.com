      If you'd like me to speak at your event, please get in touch. I also have a [speaker rider](/rider) that includes my contact details, useful details to share with me when getting in touch, and a my requirements from events that I speak at.

      If you need my bio and head shot, you can find these on my [about page](/about), available in both HTML and markdown.
