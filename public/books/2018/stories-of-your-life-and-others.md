  I absolutely loved this collection of stories. Inspiring, beautiful,
  not-so-sci-fi that it was disconnected from our world.

I absolutely loved this collection of stories. Inspiring, beautiful, not-so-sci-fi that it was disconnected from our world.  
  
What I also loved about these stories is that they made me think about my own world and and I wanted to share these conversations and thoughts with those around me.  
  
I _think_ my favourite story was 'Story of Your Life' (made in to the film The Arrival) closely followed by 'Tower of Babylon'. But even the _short short_, 'The Evolution of Human Science' was superb, right down to the very first opening paragraph!
