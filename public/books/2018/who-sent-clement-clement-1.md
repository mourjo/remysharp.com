  Really enjoyed it, and after reading Pearson's '86 fix and the sequel, I'm
  pretty certain I'll continue to read his books.

Really enjoyed it, and after reading Pearson's '86 fix and the sequel, I'm pretty certain I'll continue to read his books.  
  
The book was a solid page turner, nothing too taxing and a great pairing of characters: Beth (our protagonist) and Clement the deuteragonist. They go on an adventure to find some gold to pay off a local gangster for a debt that Beth doesn't owe.  
  
I just enjoyed the journey of following these two as trapiese through London, test their awkward boundaries and continue to question exactly where did Clement come from.  
  
Hoping to read the sequel - Wrong'un - right away!
