Another superb Saga volume. The artwork is so incredible, subtle and respectful - as in the writing.

This volume deals with some topics extremely close to my heart (baby loss) and made for some hard reading, but again, this is done in such a respectful way.

Absolutely love it, and will be chomping at the bit to get hold of volume 9!
