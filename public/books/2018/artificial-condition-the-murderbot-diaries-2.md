  Uh! I love this character! This is the 2nd book in the murderbot books and the
  main character, who I realise now doesn't have a name (nor gender as it's a
  bot) is so fun to read.

Uh! I love this character! This is the 2nd book in the murderbot books and the main character, who I realise now doesn't have a name (nor gender as it's a bot) is so fun to read.  
  
The murderbot is so dry and grumpy and so different from previous characters I've read in sci-fi.  
  
The first book definitely works as a stand alone, and although there's a self contained story in this second book, it definitely carries through a decent number of references to the earlier story that I'd not recommend reading this on it's own.  
  
Since the books are only around 160 pages, I'm moving right on to the next installment and looking forward to it already.
