A little predictable.

The book is broken across multiple eras and lives of women who are related, three in particular, changing the written voice used (so it's reasonable to follow as it jumps).

The problem I had, particularly having *just* come off _What About Men?_ was that every single male character was evil (not quite the right word, but probably suitable given the "witch" like story). 

I get that this makes sense specifically since it's from the perspective of these women, but it ended up feeling trope-like and it was easy to predict how things were going to go, which I don't enjoy so much. 

Probably a good beach read, or solo read mixed in with different genres (probably not right after _What About Men_!).
