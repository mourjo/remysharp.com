The heart break of time travel.

I enjoyed this book. The time travel core mechanic isâ€¦okay. It's not perfect/bullet proof, but it works to create the impossible problem.

The main character is, a little all over the place. It's not enough to be distracting, but often I found myself thinking "this guy isn't helping himself" as he'd continuously make the same mistakes. Maybe this could have been edited out.

Without giving too much away, the main character gets stuck out of time for several decades and so eventually makes a life for himself. A family and some happiness.

Then, he's pulled back to his timeline (in the future) without any prospect of returning or even attempting closure with his wife and daughter.

The story goes on to attempt to deal with the question: could you let go? 

The big problem being knowing _when_ to let go. There's no good time.

I've thought a lot about this in my personal life, which I think is why I could connect to the torment that the protagonist faces.

Not hard science, not a heart string puller, but thoughtful. Even if I wanted to shake the protagonist!
