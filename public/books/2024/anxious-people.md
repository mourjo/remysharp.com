A heartwarming story where not everything needs to be okay.

I really enjoyed this book. It's more of a 4.5 for me, as I'm not sure I'd need to read it again, but it left me with some warm and fuzzies inside, and that's nice to have every once in a while. 

I cared about each of the characters and the Backman gives enough (albeit) little layers to each of them that makes the characters all special. 

It was an easy read. I wanted to find out more at the end of each chapter. And it left me with a warm feeling in the end.
