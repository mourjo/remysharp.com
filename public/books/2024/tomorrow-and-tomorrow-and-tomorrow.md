Favourite book of my year: wonderful. 

I loved the characters. I've loved the story telling. I loved the passion around work. I loved the love between the characters. 

Crossing multiple decades but the crux takes place during the height of 1990s PC gaming. i.e. shortly after Doom - and our characters are games makers. 

Though the weaving part is their company that makes games, I wouldn't call this a "gamer's book". I'm certainly not a gamer by their measure, but the story put into their game design and the love they have is infectious.

The book left me genuinely inspired. The character _Marx_ makes me want to be more like him. He has purpose in helping others without being a martyr.

What's more, the book left me wanting to **make**. I love that hungry creative feeling (even if it's slightly dampened by having _too_ many projects!).

Loved it. Strong recommend.
