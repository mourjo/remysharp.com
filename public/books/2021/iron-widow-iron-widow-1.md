Didn't so much smash the patriarchy than slit it's throat and stand over it whilst it bled out!

I couldn't put this down and chomped it down in a matter of days. Great engaging and graphic writing.

The book description of a cross between Pacific Rim and Handmaid's Tale is fairly close, though in some ways I can see how this system came to be (women being treated as objects) based on our reality moreso. I suspect this is helped by the author using real Chinese history to inform characters and features of the story.

There's some pretty bleak stuff in there, and some refreshing views on relationships and status quo.

Really good stuff. Definitely reads like it would relate to the YA audience, but still very engaging for old dudes like me!
