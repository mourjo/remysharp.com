Interesting mix of ideas.

I'd read the Three Body Problem trilogy so I know that Cixin Liu's style was massive ideas of the cosmic scale and showing me how small we really are - and these short stories continue the theme.

What I didn't anticipate in these short stories was the total mix of stories (though that's entirely on me).

I didn't personally find any one story punching above the rest. I did, oddly, enjoy the story of the poet challenging the energy being and thusly breaking reality on a galactic scale.

Overall, well written, cosmic ideas, but not quite my kind of mind bending.
