A real kind of urgency and excitement in their writing. Superb.

A refreshing lesson in the history of the internet, primarily focused on the US (with a decent hat tip to Dame Wendy Hall) but really well written.

A recommendation by Jeremy Keith tipped this from my "to read" list into my brain and it was one of the easier non-fiction books I've read, purely down to Evens' writing style.

Highly recommend if you're working on the web or interested in modern computing history.
