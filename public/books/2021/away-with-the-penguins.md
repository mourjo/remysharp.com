Took a while to warm to the characters, but worth it in the end.

The story follows an exceptionally grumpy old lady, very much a stereotypical old person who doesn't trust anyone and exists almost just for themselves.

We also meet her grandson who is equally useless in his own ways. These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I'm glad I did persevere.

Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.

Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.
