summary: The kids absolutely love the Marge in Charge series.

The kids absolutely love the Marge in Charge series.

I'm suitably impressed with Isla Fisher's stories and would love to see more of these tails for the kids. We've also read the 9 book version - easily readable aloud and full of great drawings.
