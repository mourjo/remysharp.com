Felt like a long read and felt a little like it was trying to be Red Dwarf a few times, but eventually settled into an interesting and fun story.

I do admit I got lost with the length of time reading the book, but suspect it was the speed I was reading (only a handful of pages each night) - the story takes place over a matter of days - not as I thought a matter of months.

There's lots of lore in the world that's not really explained, but doesn't really get in the way. I did expect to find the humour more, but it wasn't really there for me.

Likeable characters, and a good story which stands well on it's own. I'd like to read more, but would hope the pace is a little quicker.
