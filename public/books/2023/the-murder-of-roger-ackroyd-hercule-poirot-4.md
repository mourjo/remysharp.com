Surprisingly modern for a book written nearly 100 years ago. A solid murder mystery.

Apparently one of Christie's most (or more?) controversial books which I can believe given it was written in 1926. There's talk of drugs and cocaine and even a dictaphone (which I didn't even know had been invented back then).

I did somehow guess the murderer, but I suspect it's because so many stories have come since, and it was a technique that has been employed many times since.

Still, enjoyable, and holds up well even in 2023.
