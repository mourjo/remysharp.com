So good on all levels. Utterly polished and wonderfully likeable characters.

Not much to add, except that the story was really well drawn out, and the main characters in the "Murder Club" were interesting, had depth and I could really imagine.

Understandable how this series of books have been such a hit. Absolutely looking forward to reading the rest in the series.
