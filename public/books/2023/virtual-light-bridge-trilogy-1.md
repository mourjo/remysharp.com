Decent enough, even if I didn't really get it.

I just kind of plodded through this book. Not particularly a page turner, but intelligent enough to keep reading. Not entirely sure if I fully understood the Virtual Light part, or rather what was the point in everyone wanting to get hold of these glasses.

What was interesting was the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic (I'm assuming around the time the book was written), and how it was used in some ways, but I'm not entirely sure why or how, to say it had been overcome by one individual that was immune... But I really didn't understand where this fit into the story.
