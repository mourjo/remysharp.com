summary: 'Kind of lovely. Kind of trippy.'

Kind of lovely. Kind of trippy.

The book drops me right into an utterly bizarre world inside a building where waves crash and tides rise and fall.

Piranesi, the protagonist, and our story teller, is one of only two humans in this world - both scientists trying to understand the world their world.

The book does a great job of pulling me through the story and suspending belief whilst Piranesi records his diary entries.

It was hard to anticipate where the story was going, but I had an inkling of the secret that would eventually unfold.

What was particularly nice was Piranesi's wonder and joy at the world he inhabits where another character could have easily been fearful and fighting against the world.
