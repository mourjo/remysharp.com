Having seen the author present at a conference, I wanted to read this story: and I'm glad I did.

The story is about a time-travelling serial killer who is being hunted by one of his victims.

What attracted me to the book, was Beukes' explained that there was a crime that had occurred (not to her, but someone in her life) and that ultimately, as with a lot of reality, justice was not served. She wanted to use that, in a sense, to control the world and have control of the outcome for the antagonist.

The story itself was complex, but I was never lost in the time travel. It was brutal in some parts, and winding in others, but I was always looking forward to the next chapter.
