Accidentally thought this was a work of fiction (it's not), but still enjoyed the book.

This is a memoir of Katherine Ryan's life from her childhood to more recent years. There's some fun and funny anecdotes, but also some more serious topics giving me a little more insight into the person she is (and coincidentally, her good friend Jimmy Carr, who I've generally disliked but her book has helped me see them in a new light).

I don't particularly enjoy reading memoirs or biographies, and I seemed to go through a run of comedian memoirs recently, but this was generally good (though I still would have liked to read a fictional book by her too!).
