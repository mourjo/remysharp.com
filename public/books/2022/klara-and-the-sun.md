Interesting ideas, but a little flat.

Klara is, for want of a better expression, a curious Android. The story is told through their perspective, which itself is unique with respect to machines being curious about their surroundings.

It felt like it was set in some kind of 50s America but never really committed to a location or time (though it could have done, it just didn't spike for me).

The story is, kind of lovely, whilst also being a little...dull and predictable. I felt like, though the ending is in some ways beautiful (for Klara), it's also pretty flat.

If you enjoy the kind of story that tells of what it might be like to be a machine being subservient to humans (and happy to be) and the slow going ons being their eyes, then this is for you. For me, a little to...15mph in a 30.
