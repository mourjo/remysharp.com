Was one of the first "big" books I read as a kid. Sadly it didn't hold up to the test of time.

A nice story about mice and animals (and a Badger I remember being called Constance), but it smacked of heroes are boys and damsels are girls, which might have been fine back in the 80s, but not so much for me now.
