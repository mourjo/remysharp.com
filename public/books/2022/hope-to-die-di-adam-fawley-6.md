Literal page turner. Over 400 pages and I swallowed it in days.

I've enjoyed all the DI Fawley books, and keep Hunter's books on pre-order as soon as they're announced.

I really enjoy these books and every time I get to the end of a chapter, I immediately need to find out what's happening next, so chew on!

The DI Fawley books are responsible for 2am bedtimes, and I'm not even sorry!
