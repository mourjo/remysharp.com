Skip Skipping Christmas.

I read this based on a recommendation on social media and somehow missed checking the existing reviews. Also because I hadn't read John Grisham before I expected something even mildly challenging. I was completely wrong.

Skipping Christmas doesn't have a single decent character in it. They're all first class privilege selfish individuals with zero character progression.

The writing is also extremely basic, written exactly as if I were watching a screen - which I'm not doing - and trite to boot.

Aweful. I won't be reaching for a Grisham book in a hurry!
