  I read this to my son, who turned 7 just after we started. We did end up doing
  some epic bedtime reading sessions to complete whole chapters. And as with
  books I've read to him, I shall let his own words dictate this review :)

I liked the bit where Harry goes underground and in the house, because I wish I had a scary house under the whomping willow.

When Black came into the room, I thought it was scary, and I thought it was going to happen in my bedroom!

The sad bit was when Buckbeak died (but oh yeah, they rescued him).

It's good, and a little bit scary.
