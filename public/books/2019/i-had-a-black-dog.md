Beautifully illustrated and communicated. Some particular pages rang more than true for me and it's useful and helps to see the way others articulate their own depression.<i></i><br /><br />With such a simple read, I'll be passing this on to my family members to read so that they have a little more insight into what goes on inside my own head.
