Good to read aloud to the kids (took about 15-20 minutes), and a beautiful message in the story, whereby the adult reading...me...might have caught a frog in their throat!

The truth pixie lives a life of loneliness because she always tells the truth, and that truth can get her in to trouble. She decides to leave home and during her adventure meets a girl who is sad because she's going to be moving home away from friends and everything she knows. 

The truth pixie tells her that it will be sad, and there will be times in life that she'll be lonely, but that life is full of wonderful moments and love and warmth. A good message to remind ourselves of during the day to day grind of life.

Also beautifully illustrated.
