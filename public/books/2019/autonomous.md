summary: >-
  Enjoyed this book. Definitely a modern look at the possibilities of the future
  ahead of us. I have to admin I was expecting more robots and augmentations and
  sci-fi, but this leant more towards a political statement in particular about
  free access to healthcare (which is something I care a lot about being in the
  UK and having the NHS).

An enjoyable story and some strong characters.
