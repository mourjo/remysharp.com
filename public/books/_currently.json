    "review": "All throughout reading this book, I found myself smiling.<br /><i></i><br />This book was published in 1938 and tells the tale of Miss Pettigrew, a failing governess who's life thus far has been quiet, polite and \"ladylike\", but, as the title gives away, this day, she lives.<br /><br />I've never before read a book that I've non-stop smiled whilst reading. <br /><br />I found myself falling quickly in love with Miss Pettigrew and wanting her to have all the kindness she deserved."
