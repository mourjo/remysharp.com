summary: Pretty much middle of the road read.
---
Pretty much middle of the road read.  
  
I had expected some mildly challenging literary content but this wasn't it. The main character, Cormoran Strike is well drawn, but it sort of reads like the name came first and the whole character was built up around that.  
  
Frustratingly the book opens with a back and forth between Strike and, what I thought and hoped would be the relatable character and even the protagonist, Robin - and this lead me to believe the book would be told from _both_ their points of view, but quickly after a few chapters Robin's character is very much tossed aside as very much inconsequential to the storyâ€¦ so why even bother?  
  
It read like I was watching a program on TV, and not one that I'd put too much effort into watching. I had hoped for something more interesting or perhaps more challenging.  
  
I'd imagine this might be useful as a beach read. Maybe.
