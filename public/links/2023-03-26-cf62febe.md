# The Great Gaslighting of the JavaScript Era

A long read, but a worthwhile one - in my head their voice was definitely just shy of shouty! :)

Being a JS developer first and foremost since pre-Node days, it puts me in a funny spot that I absolutely agree with everything said in this article, whilst also considering that I pick JS _on the server_ to suit me.

When it comes to the front-end, I'm pretty sick of the poison that's been sold to us for over a decade.

The web's war for JS libraries/etc summarised excellently with:

> Itâ€™s a popularity contest. Plain and simple.

> And that popularity contest can change on a dime.

> 10 years ago, it was AngularJS.

> Today, itâ€™s React.

> Tomorrow, it will be something else because thatâ€™s inevitable.

Absolutely this - I felt exactly the same when I had peers and colleagues trying to shove Angular down my throat.

But it's the future, the kids who come to the industry and will continue it. As Jared White writes,

> but all those bright-eyed eager newcomers getting churned out of code schools knowing only React?

> Those jobs will be gone. ðŸ˜•

Grim future.
