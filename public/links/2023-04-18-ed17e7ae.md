# The A.I. Dilemma

An excellent discussion on the explosion, or even, implosion, of AI and how it's being tested and developed in public when the implications seem to have been swept aside in favour of the arms race between the big corps.

Policies and law haven't been written and it's the experts that don't even have the confidence you'd hope to hear about:

> 50% of A.I. researchers believe there's a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct from our inability to control AI

Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin discuss the risk to society and how safety measures are far from adequate and laws _need_ to be implemented.

> When you invent a new technology, _you uncover a new class of responsibilities_

It's a long watch at a little over an hour, but strongly recommend as we plough head long into a future where AI is inter-tangled with society.
