# better-mobile-inputs.netlify.app/

A useful web page to show visually what the mobile assistive keyboard looks like given different input types.

Specifically, and TIL - the `inputmode` can be different, i.e. using a `type="text"` field but `inputmode="url"` to help with partials like ".com" (if the input field didn't need URL validation for instance).
